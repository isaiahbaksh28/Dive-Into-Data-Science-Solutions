# Dive-Into-Data-Science-Solutions

Code Snippets from the book Dive into Data Science by Bradford Tuckfield. Really good book for learning the basics of Data Science. Most of the code is snippets from the book, the datasets used are all available from Brad's website, and how to access them is given in the book.
